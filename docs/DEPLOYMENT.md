# Paw Mall — Rollout Log

Tracks the actual rollout of [PLAN.md](PLAN.md), phase by phase: what was built, on which branch
and pull request, how it was checked, and what's left.

**Environment:** development only. Nothing is deployed and no cloud resources are created until
the owner decides (see PLAN.md, "Conventions for Claude Code"). "Rolled out" here means merged
into `main` and passing its "Done when" check locally (Docker Postgres, `wrangler dev`, Expo Go).

## Workflow

Every phase follows the same steps:

1. Branch from an up-to-date `main`: `phase-N/<short-name>` (e.g. `phase-1/foundation`).
2. Open a draft pull request early, titled `Phase N: <name>`, and link it in the table below.
3. Build the phase; commit in small, clear steps.
4. Before marking ready: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm test` pass, and the phase's
   "Done when" check passes on a phone or simulator.
5. Update this file on the same branch: status, dates, checks, notes and follow-ups.
6. Merge the PR into `main` (squash), delete the branch, then start the next phase.

Statuses: **Not started** · **In progress** · **In review** (PR ready) · **Done** (merged and
checked) · **Blocked**.

## Phase details

### Phase 1 — Foundation

- **Scope:** monorepo (pnpm, Turborepo), TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, `CLAUDE.md`; Expo
  app boots; Hono API answers `/health` locally; Postgres + PostGIS in Docker; i18next with `es`
  and `en`.
- **Done when:** the app opens on a phone or simulator via Expo Go with a Spanish welcome screen
  and reaches the local API.
- **Branch / PR:** `phase-1/foundation` / PR_REF
- **Status:** In progress (waiting for the device check)
- **Checks:**
  - [x] `pnpm lint` (includes the `i18next/no-literal-string` rule, confirmed to reject JSX text)
  - [x] `pnpm typecheck`
  - [x] `pnpm test`: 18 tests (shared 5, api 3, mobile 10)
  - [x] `pnpm i18n:check` and `pnpm format:check`
  - [x] `curl localhost:8787/health` →
        `{"status":"ok","version":"0.1.0","database":{"status":"ok","postgis":"3.6.4"}}`, also
        from the LAN IP
  - [x] `expo export` bundles for iOS and Android
  - [ ] Done-when check on device (Expo Go)
- **Notes:**
  - Postgres 17 + PostGIS 3.6.4, pg_trgm and unaccent, from migration `0000_extensions`.
  - Docker publishes Postgres on port **5434** (Ferre Mall uses 5433).
  - The API reads `DATABASE_URL` from `wrangler.toml` `[vars]`; no Hyperdrive or other cloud
    resources. `workers_dev = false`, and there is no deploy script.
  - `/health` still answers when Postgres is down (`database.status: "unavailable"`), so the app
    can tell "no server" from "no database".
  - Tooling dependencies beyond the Tech stack table, all as in Ferre Mall: `postgres`
    (postgres.js driver for Drizzle), `wrangler`, `drizzle-kit`, `@cloudflare/workers-types`,
    `typescript-eslint`, `eslint-config-expo`, `eslint-plugin-i18next` and `tailwindcss` 3
    (NativeWind).
- **Follow-ups:**
  - No app icon or splash yet (Expo defaults); add them with the app store readiness work.
  - `pnpm peers check` lists two transitive peer warnings (`react-dom` 19.3 wants React 19.3;
    `@react-native/metro-config` 0.87). `expo install --check` reports everything aligned.

### Phase 2 — Pet businesses

- **Scope:** data model; DENUE importer for 465911, 541941, 541942 and name-based picks from
  812990; categories; Overture enrichment; website checks.
- **Done when:** `curl` lists real vets and pet stores near the Zócalo by category, with the
  PLAN.md counts (±1%), and grooming entries come only from matching names.

### Phase 3 — Search and map

- **Scope:** search (name, city, state; within radius; nearest first), map (circle, clusters,
  legend, location and compass buttons), directions chooser, place pages, category chips and
  filters.

  "Cómo llegar" opens the chosen maps app.

## Production deployment

Not planned. When the owner decides to deploy, add a section here covering environments, cloud
resources, secrets, migrations, rollback and costs (see PLAN.md, "Later" and "App Store and Google
Play readiness").
